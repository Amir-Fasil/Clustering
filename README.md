I have added a code for DBSCAN and calculated the Silhouette Score to compare it to K-mean algorithms 
            Silhouette Score for k-mean = 0.582
            Silhouette Score for DBSCAN = 0.656
The Silhoutte score for DBSCAN is greater by 0.074 from the corresponding k-mean algorithm.

I have written a 3 page report on DBSCAN instead of 2 because I found the algorithm intriging.
